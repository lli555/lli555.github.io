I am currently a Computer Science student at UMass Amherst. I love lots of things, including but not limited to piano, badminton, cooking, coding, and cybersecurity. More importantly, I love traveling and going on adventures. 

I specialize in web exploitation and pentesting. With that being said, I'm also occasionally a pwn and rev CTF player.

This is a blog currently documenting my CTF writeups and author writeups. I'm working on documenting HTB writeups and other projects/guides I'm interested in.
